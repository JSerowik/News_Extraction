It was the index’s fourth straight negative session, the first such streak since March, underscoring investor uncertainty as U.S. Senate Republicans attempt to reconcile their version of a tax-cut bill with that of the House of Representatives.
“It’s hard to speculate on what the final bill is going to say,” said Sean O‘Hara, director at Pacer Financial Inc.
The bill passed on Saturday by Republican senators included a last-minute change to retain the corporate alternative minimum tax, or AMT, which had initially been removed.
Including the AMT could negate parts of the bill seen as beneficial to tech companies and other corporations.
